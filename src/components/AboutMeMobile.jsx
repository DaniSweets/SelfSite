            <p>I am a Front End Software Engineer with a background in healthcare. I recently graduated the University of Kansas' full-stack web development bootcamp, where I created responsive web applications utilizing React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, as well as many CSS frameworks. Due to my experience in the healthcare field, I excel at time management, efficiency, and accuracy in all my work.</p>
            {/* <p>I am the type of person that is always learning new things, and tinkering with things I donâ€™t understand yet. I have a lot of experience with creative problem solving and enjoy finding solutions that can make everyone happy.
            I found myself in the workforce being drawn toward computer-based problem solving, and when possible even created programs to help me accomplish my work efficiently. I realized that I would be happier and more fulfilled if I could problem solve full time as my main profession.</p>
            <p>As a former compounding pharmacy technician, I worked in clean-room settings to create individualized medications for patients. Due to this experience, I excel at time management, efficiency, and accuracy in all my work. I also learn new concepts and procedures very quickly, but am not afraid to ask questions when I need help.</p> */}
